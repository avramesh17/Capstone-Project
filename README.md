# Capstone-Project

<h1>Machine Learning Project</h1>

<body> This is my first time working on a machine learning project. I got the chance to work with an extremely large dataset(over 20,000 rows)
and went through the entire process of cleaning the data, analyzing the data, and then going through and feeding it into the models. The data
primarily deals with collisions, and includes various information including location, time of day, number of individuals involved, and so on.


I thought it would be interesting to train a model to help assist with collision prevention. Namely, by providing some key data inputs into the
model including but not limited to Weather, and light conditions, whether a probability of crash could be predicted in order to help the driver.
The different models used are K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. I felt that these 3 worked the best because the data
through my cleaning has been converted into a categorical format, and we can reach discrete values of probability from working with these models.
